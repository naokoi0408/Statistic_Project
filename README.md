This homework assignment analyzes racial differences in legal financial obligations owed to the state of Alabama, using descriptive statistics and visualizations. It also tests a theory on college basketball game outcomes by calculating conditional probabilities.

To achieve a perfect score, I needed to accurately calculate the mean of absolute values in questions 3a and 3c. Additionally, in question 3b, I overcomplicated the calculations for certain events and mixed up variables, which impacted the final probability values.
